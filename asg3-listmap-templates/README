This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Daniel Lavell (dlavell@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Gavin Mack (gmmack@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Daniel Lavell spent __2__ hours working alone.
Gavin Mack spent __2__ hours working alone.
We spent __30__ hours working together.
Daniel Lavell spent __15__ hours driving.
Gavin Mack spent __15__ hours driving.

Please grade the work submitted by dlavell@ucsc.edu
and not the work submitted by gmmack@ucsc.edu.
